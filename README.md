Please remember that these keys are KMS keys and you would need KMS activation server setup at your end for activating your Windows Server 2022 install. Else you would be able to move past the setup key screen while installing the server but WILL NOT be able to activate Windows Server 2022 after install. This is because the build 20344.1 is a production signed build.
